        <h2 align ="center">About This Site</h2>
        <p align="justify">When I found that I needed to make a site about llamas, I think to myself, <em>wow, that's never happened before</em>.
            I figured that between doing class projects and attempting to have a social life, I have approximately 10 hours to build this site. Here's the breakdown:
        </p>

        <p align ="justify">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hour 1:</strong> Design Phase. <br>I was thinking to challenge myself not to use any framework for this site. 
                    But having just built <a href="https://irennalumbuun.github.io/Be-Okay/" target="_target"> a web app </a> without any framework at all a couple weeks prior, I decided that it was enough to showcase my understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
                    I decided that I will use JQuery to simply the process of manipulating DOM.</li>
                <li><strong>Hour 2-5: </strong>Writing llama-articles.html<br>
                    This is the page containing summary, history, behavior, and nutrition of llamas. I decided to include a slider on the history section to show my understanding on manipulating DOM.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hour 6:</strong> Writing about.html</li>
                <li><strong>Hour 7-8:</strong>Writing quiz.html<br>
                This is the "meet your llama" section. Similarly, this was also written to show my understanding of DOM and also to showcase a little bit of personality. </li>
                <li><strong>Hour 9 - 9.5:</strong> re-styling, making sure everything works on web and mobile the way I want them to.<br>
                I forgot that making things look pretty take slightly longer than I expect</li>
                <li><strong>Hour 10:</strong> Writing this very page you're currently reading! <br>
                I can't lie. Making a web about llamas is more interesting than I would've thought.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
